They get a bit higher Ne estimates, though, by using shorter generation times for chimps (although I'm not sure why this should matter except that they get different mutation rates per generation this way which looks a bit to me like cheating).

Has later studies increased this again? Check genome papers.

En konsekvens af at vi ikke ser dette bliver s{\aa} at der m{\aa} have v{\ae}ret meget lidt hybridisering (af den ene eller anden grund).

Jeg er ikke helt sikker p{\aa} at jeg kan lide hvordan denne model tilpasser at der er lige meget neanderthal i europ{\ae}rer og asiatere, da det kun kan tilpasses ved at fifle med talene (range af neandertal, mest) og alle andre befolkninger end netop de to sampling punkter vil ikke n{\o}dvendigvis f{\aa} samme fraktion.  Det m{\aa} v{\ae}re meget nemt at teste om det er tilf{\ae}ldet ved at sample lidt rundt.

Det er dog muligt at den efterf{\o}lgende invation af neolithiske mennesker viskede det signal ud -- for jeg antager at signalet set her egentlig kun vil g{\ae}lde for paleolitiske mennesker. Hmm, ja, jeg ved ikke hvordan den neolitiske wave-expansion p{\aa}virker resultaterne her...

Borneo orang-utans clusters tightly together while there is a large diversity in Sumatran orang-utans, possibly with three main clusters, one that is the same as the Bornean, and two that are exclusively Sumatran where one of these is closer to the Borneo orang-utans than the other.

They provide a hypothesis for explaining the large diversity within Sumatran orang-utans: After collonizing Indonesea, the Toba volcano killed off the northern Sumatran orang-utans, and Sumatra was then re-colonized by Borneo, main land, and south-Sumatra orangutans, resulting in the three clusters in Sumatra today. The main land orang-utans have, of course, later become extinct.

Interestingly: if this is true, we should see something that looks more like admixture than as allopatric of IM split between the two orangutans.
